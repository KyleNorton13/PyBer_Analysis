# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to complete a request provided by V. Isualize. The requested analysis contained a dataframe of ride-sharing data filtered bhy the city type. The city types for this were rural, urban and suburban. After completing this we needed to create a visualization for the data collected previously. The visualization was a multiple-line-graph showing the total weekly fares for each city type. The analysis conducted throughout the process will be provided to  PyBer to assist them in their decision-making process. 
## Results
There are numerous differences within the ride-sharing data that provide insight by city type. Rural city types have fewer rides, drivers and total fares, however they also have the highest average fare per ride and average fare per driver when compared to suburban and urban city types. The urabn city type is the complete opposite of rural in that it has the largest amount of rides, drivers, and total fares, but has the lowest average fare per ride and average fare per driver. The Suburban city type is in the middle of the two types previously discussed.
