# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to complete a request provided by V. Isualize. The requested analysis contained a dataframe of ride-sharing data filtered bhy the city type. The city types for this were rural, urban and suburban. After completing this we needed to create a visualization for the data collected previously. The visualization was a multiple-line-graph showing the total weekly fares for each city type. The analysis conducted throughout the process will be provided to  PyBer to assist them in their decision-making process.
